          <h5>Kamusta?</h5>
          <p>
            Hello, I'm Maui Jane Roche, 20 years old, currently studying at
            the Polytechnic University of the Philippines, pursuing a Diploma
            in Information Technology. I do have a lot of interests and
            hobbies that keep me engaged and motivated. I enjoy dancing,
            singing, and watching movies, which allow me to express myself
            creatively. I also love reading, as it helps me expand my
            knowledge and imagination. When I'm not busy with my studies, I
            find joy in writing short stories and editing photos.

      <p>Face-to-Face or Online Classes?</p>
      <p>
        If I were to ask about face-to-face or online classes, it depends a
        little, especially considering some students whose homes are far away
        from the school, and also the weather. But in my case, I would still
        make the effort to go to school and take away something valuable.
        Because I'm in college now and I'm not getting younger anymore, So I
        don't have the chance to complain because everything I'm doing is for
        the future, and I don't want to waste the opportunity to learn
        face-to-face because I don't want to go back to the pandemic era. I
        don't want to return to the phase of online classes where I lose all
        my focus and waste my time playing during class. Just like what Prof.
        Steven taught us, "It may be hard, but it will be worth it."
      </p>
      <p>Why did we conduct a Face-to-Face rather an online class?</p>
      <p>
        When we returned home after our session with Prof. Steven, one of my
        groupmates asked our senior, who had been assigned to us for the last
        exercise, about their experience. They shared that they often struggle
        to retain the lessons taught in the sessions and are frequently unable
        to attend due to technical reasons. And some students didn't paying
        attention in class. Though, face-to-face sessions are appreciated by
        some students since it is easier for the professor to focus on the
        students and for the students to engage.

          <h5>Kamusta?</h5>
          <p>
            Hello, I'm Maui Jane Roche, 20 years old, currently studying at
            the Polytechnic University of the Philippines, pursuing a Diploma
            in Information Technology. I do have a lot of interests and
            hobbies that keep me engaged and motivated. I enjoy dancing,
            singing, and watching movies, which allow me to express myself
            creatively. I also love reading, as it helps me expand my
            knowledge and imagination. When I'm not busy with my studies, I
            find joy in writing short stories and editing photos.

        <p>
          When I started college, I didn't expect the challenges that would
          come my way. I thought it would be similar to high school, where I
          could just coast through. But some people say that college is the
          first major stepping stone towards achieving your dreams and
          becoming who you want to be in the future. It all began when the
          second semester started at our school. I didn't realize how
          difficult it would be to pass my subjects, but this is just a part
          of what you have to go through if you want to succeed.
        </p>
        <p>
          This brought up thoughts like, "What if I'm not on the right course?
          What if I don't pass? What if this isn't really for me?" These are
          the questions that constantly run through my mind. “Maybe if I had
          pursued the course I wanted, I wouldn't be struggling this much. Or
          even if I did struggle, at least I'd be doing something I love." But
          no, I shouldn't think that way. It's not always about what I want.
          Given the hardships of life, I can't afford to aim for something
          impossible in my current situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, if I see myself 5 years from now, I hope to be working in an
          industry that aligns with my course, even though programming isn't
          my passion. But I know that IT is a vast field with many areas to
          explore, and I am still finding the one that will excel my skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet I really picture myself working in a good company, perhaps in a
          movie production. Where I would be a director and to publish a movie
          of my own.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I am committed to being able to provide for my family's needs.
          And to give back all the sacrifices my mother and father made for
          me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will ensure they will experience the kind of life they never had
          before. We won't have to worry about our bills or daily meals. And
          my mother will finally be able to return to her home province after
          27 years.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for myself, I see a woman who continues to pursue the things she
          has loved since she was a child, who keeps reaching for her goals
          and ambitions, and who studies the course she truly desires because
          she is now financially stable.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope that all of this will come true. Though only the Lord knows
          what lies ahead, But I believe that if you work hard, nothing is
          impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I always remind myself that sometimes the things you want do not
          align with God's plans. But you don't realize that He is just
          preparing you for something better.
